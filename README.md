# Geometry-Box
It is a desktop application for mathematics with 3 main parts :-
- The Canvas : The user has the independence to do whatever he or she wants, like drawing or writing anything using a pen and a white sheet.
- Daily Geometry : The user deals with complex geometries along with basic coordinates and the system generates correct geometrical figures according to the inputs.
- Equation Visualizer : The user gives an equation as an input and the system generates a graphical representation of the equation.
